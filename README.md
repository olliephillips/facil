#Facil. A static website generator

##Maybe..

Experimental project to build a static website generator in Go. The various other projects I looked at, though I'm sure they are excellent, just felt too complex and focus mainly on blog copy. 

I had an idea that I could maybe cater for both website and blog copy and keep it relatively simple.

Since there's not much to see here yet I guess we will have to wait and see!

##BTW

'Facil' is catalan for 'easy'.
