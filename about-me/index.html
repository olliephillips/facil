						<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Should you wish to know</p>	
					</header>
					
					<p>I&rsquo;m currently very interested in Go (Golang), <a href="http://www.espruino.com">Espruino</a>, ESP8266, IoT, Augmented reality and Web RTC. You might also know me from the <a href="http://www.concrete5.org">concrete5</a> community, and maybe, way back in the day, the Dotnetnuke community. I also use PHP and JavaScript daily.</p>

<p>RethinkDB and IBM Bluemix are technologies I want to do more with.</p>

<p>I was the author of one of the first <a href="http://cookiesdirective.com">cookies disclosure scripts</a>, which is still going. I was an accountant who used to build intranet financial systems for planning, budgeting and reporting. In 2007 I quit accounting and took up web application development full-time. I could not tell you where the time since has gone.</p>

<p>On holiday last year I built a course map and online scorecard for a 9 hole golf course in France, using the HTML5 Geolocation API, Google Maps, Websockets, Golang and Bluemix.</p>

<p>I want the future to be HTML5 apps rather than native iOS and Android apps. I&rsquo;m waiting for WebRTC on iOS.</p>

<p>I do a lot of messing. I pick stuff up and put it down. I don&rsquo;t always finish stuff. But this is how I learn. In fact most of the good stuff I&rsquo;ve done in my career has its roots in something I&rsquo;ve simply been meddling with at some point usually much earlier. Bigger ideas take time to come together and are usually made up of many smaller ones - stepping stones if you like.</p>

<p>I used to blog, and I used to do the social media thing, but I don&rsquo;t so much anymore. It seems enough to build stuff, and leave it on Github and Bitbucket. What else is there to say?</p>

<p>You can still follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/slippytrumpet">Twitter</a> if you want. I&rsquo;m a fairly good bet as I don&rsquo;t say much and won&rsquo;t get in your face. I&rsquo;ll generally follow you back too, especially if you&rsquo;re interested in the sort of stuff I am.</p>
